# Hey there! I'm Piyush

I'm a self-driven developer with a background in Aerospace Engineering and a deep commitment to learning and building. After overcoming some major personal hurdles, I'm now back on the track to learn things and find inner peace... and try to get into a good job/university.

Here's a rough guideline that I am following, starting August 2025:

![The plan.](home_resources/long_term_plan.png)

Note: this was given to me by GPT5 after I told it a list of things I plan to do. My own plan may vary. I will be updating my page to show the correct plan.

## What I'm Doing Now
-  Velleman proofs, Algorithms, DSA on leetcode, learning Rust.
-  Documenting my journey on [my learning site](https://k-tro.github.io)
-  Building real projects in **Python**, **C++** and **Rust**

## Current Skillset
- Languages: `C++ (STL)`, `Python (np, pd, torch)`, `Java (base)`
- Tools: `Git`, `WSL2`, `VS Code`, `Obsidian`
- Concepts: OOP, DSA, MLPs, Engineering Math (UG)

## Goals
- Join a good intern/job soon.
- Build a portfolio of **deployable, useful software**
- Eventually explore advanced topics in ML, statistics, and systems
- ~~Design a machine learning workflow for Aerospace Engineering solutions~~
