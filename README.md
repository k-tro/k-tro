# Hey there! I'm Piyush

I'm a learner with a background in Aerospace Engineering and a deep commitment to learning and building. After overcoming some major personal hurdles, I'm now back on the track to learn things and find inner peace... and try to get into a good job/university.

## What I'm Doing Now
#### Getting used to build tools following a youtube series by /c/cppdev.
#### Doing two ambitious projects:
- [Ray tracing with gravity distortion and postprocessing](https://github.com/k-tro/raytracer)
- [Benchmarking VAEs and their variants across multiple datasets after learning how they work](https://github.com/k-tro/VAE_and_beyond)

#### Doing the archived [CS336 Stanford course](https://stanford-cs336.github.io/spring2025/)

#### Applying for jobs and internships.
#### Trying ~~not to be late for this~~ to do this in one year less:
<details>
  <summary> A lofty plan to learn fundamentals of "advanced" math and cs. </summary>
  <img src = home_resources/long_term_plan.png alt="rough plan">
  The above is what GPT5 suggested to me when I told it what I want to do.
  Yes, I have been warned that the GPTs give unrealistic deadlines/timelines/workload. 
  But this order doesn't look too bad and I am not devoting my full time to what GPT5 told me.
</details>


#### while also doing four Coursera specializations:
- [IBM Data Science Fundamentals](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-fundamentals-python-sql)
- [Meta Full-Stack Developer](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/meta-full-stack-developer)
- [Applied Data Science with Python - Michigan](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python)
- [MLOps - Duke](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mlops-machine-learning-duke)


## Current Skillset
- Languages: `C++ (STL)`, `Python (np, pd, torch)`, `Java (base)`
- Tools: `Git`, `WSL2`, `VS Code`, `CMake`, `Obsidian`
- Concepts: OOP, DSA, MLPs, Engineering Math (UG)

## Goals
- Join a good intern/job soon. Good means somewhere I can actually grow.
- Build a portfolio of deployable, useful software.
- Build an in-depth understanding of most of the math and cs concepts that are taught in their major UG courses.
- Eventually explore advanced topics in math, CS, ML, statistics, and systems.
- Eventually fund myself through a top university outside of India.

Regardless of how you ended up here, I am willing to talk about music, physics, math, and cats.
